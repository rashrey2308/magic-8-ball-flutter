# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

>This is a companion project to The App Brewery's Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp, check out the full course at [www.appbrewery.co](https://www.appbrewery.co/)

## Goal

The objective of this challenge was to solidify what I've learn't in the Dicee tutorial. This app guided me through the steps required to build an 8 ball app and helped me in applying what I have learnt about Stateless and Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What I created

I made a magical 8 ball app, which will give the answers to all the tricky questions in life. You can make the ball change at the press of a button.
